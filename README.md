1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client The Gamign Room seeks to create a web-based verison of their existing game, Draw it or Lose it and would like it tro be accessible accross multiple platforms. The game involves teams competing to guess drawn images in a set time. The web-based version must be able to host multiple teams, ensure unique games and team names, and allow one instance of the game at a time.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think my reccodations were well writtin. They had good concise information on all reccomended systems and architectures.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The document helped me stay on track by having clear goal in mind to reach when working on this. The UML diagram was also extemely helpful.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

More detail on the reqirments and design constraints. I only breifly touched on these i would like much more detail in the future.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
6. 
I interpeted the clients needs has needed to use software which enables them to run their game on multiple OS and Systems. Its important to consider this due design restaints built within certain softwares. 

7. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached desining this software based off the clients needs. Since the clients wants the application to run on multiple platforms and os i picked things that were compatible with using multiple systems and OS.
